To set the login username and password, add a file called 'login.php' in the folder 'data'.
Its contents are:

<?php $ADMIN_AUTH = "username:password";

If this file doesn't exist, the default username and password will be "admin:blinkenlichten".

Also, while not stricly necessary, it is recommended to set a cronjob which calls /php/scrape_now.php every day.
